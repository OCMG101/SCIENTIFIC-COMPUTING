# SCIENTIFIC-COMPUTING

## **Week 1 Assignment**

### **Objective of each script:**  
This repository houses Python scripts that demonstrate key programming principles. Each script serves a distinct role:  

- **datatypes.py** -> Explores different Python data types, performs type conversions, and prints variable classifications.  
- **control_structures.py** -> Uses conditional logic, loops, and functions to analyze numbers and generate sequences.  
- **modular_functions.py** -> Implements reusable functions to compute areas of various geometric shapes.  
- **numpy_basics.py** -> Introduces NumPy for numerical data processing and array manipulation.

### **How to run the scripts:**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/OCMG101/SCIENTIFIC-COMPUTING.git
   cd #desired_destination
   ```  
2. Navigate to the relevant folder:  
   ```sh
   cd python_basics or numpy_intro
   ```  
3. Execute the script(s).
